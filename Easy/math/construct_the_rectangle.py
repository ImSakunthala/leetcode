"""A web developer needs to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area,
your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:

The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
Return an array [L, W] where L and W are the length and width of the web page you designed in sequence.



Example 1:

Input: area = 4 Output: [2,2] Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4],
[2,2], [4,1]. But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal
compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2. Example 2:

Input: area = 37
Output: [37,1]
Example 3:

Input: area = 122122
Output: [427,286]


Constraints:

1 <= area <= 107
