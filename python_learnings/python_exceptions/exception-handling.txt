1) Write a program that takes two numbers as input from the user and divides the first number by the second.
Handle the ZeroDivisionError exception to handle the case where the second number is 0.

2) Write a program that reads a list of integers from the user, and prints the average of the numbers.
Handle the ValueError exception to handle the case where the user enters non-integer values.

3) Write a program that opens a file and reads the contents of the file.
Handle the FileNotFoundError exception to handle the case where the file doesn't exist.

4) Write a program that takes a list of numbers and prints the largest and smallest numbers in the list.
Handle the ValueError exception to handle the case where the list is empty.

Write a program that takes names and ages from user as input, and print the age of name given by user.
Handle the KeyError exception to handle the case where a name is not found in the dictionary.


Write a program that takes a list of strings and converts them to integers.
 Handle the ValueError exception to handle the case where a string cannot be converted to an integer.

Write a program that takes two lists and returns the common elements between the lists.
 Handle the IndexError exception to handle the case where one of the lists is shorter than the other.

Write a program that takes a string and prints the number of vowels in the string.
Handle the TypeError exception to handle the case where the input is not a string.

Write a program that takes a list of numbers and returns the second largest number in the list.
Handle the ValueError exception to handle the case where the list has fewer than 2 elements.

Write a program that reads a list of numbers from the user,and converts them to a list of integers.
The program should handle the ValueError exception if the user enters a non-integer value, and ask the user to enter a valid number.
The program should continue until the user enters a list of 10 numbers. After the user enters the 10 numbers,
the program should print the average of the numbers.
This exercise requires you to handle multiple exceptions in a loop, and to ask the user for input repeatedly until a specific condition is met.
It also requires you to accumulate and calculate the average of a list of numbers,
which will test your knowledge of lists and basic mathematical operations in Python.
